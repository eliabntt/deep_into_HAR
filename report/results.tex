\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\MR{In this section, you should provide the numerical results. You are free to decide the structure of this section. As general rules of thumb, use plots to describe your results, showing, e.g., precision, recall and \mbox{F-measure} as a function of the system (learning) parameters. Present the material in a progressive and logical manner, starting with simple things and adding details and explaining more complex behaviors as you go. Also, do not try to explain / show multiple concepts at a time. Try to \textbf{address one concept at a time}, explain it properly, and only then move to the next one.\\
The best results are obtained by generating the graphs in either \texttt{encapsulated postscript (eps)} or \texttt{pdf} formats. To plot your figures, use the Latex \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
