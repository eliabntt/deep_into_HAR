\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\red{Maximum length for the whole report is 9 pages. Abstract, introduction and related work should take max two pages.}\\

\MR{A good way of structuring the introduction is as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{General (short) intro:} One paragraph to introduce your work, describing the scenario {\it at large}, its relevance, to prepare the reader to what follows and convince her/him that the paper focuses on an important setup / problem. Please keep this part short (I usually do five to eight lines), as this part is rather standard, \textbf{but} at the same time it has to be there. 
\item \textbf{Put the problem into perspective:} A second paragraph where you immediately delve into the specific problem that you are tackling, starting to point the finger towards your contribution. Here, you describe the importance of such problem, providing examples (citing papers from the literature, possibly recent ones) of previous solutions attempts, and of why these failed {\it to provide a complete answer}. This second paragraph should not be too long, as otherwise the reader will get bored and will abandon your paper... It should be concisely written, something like 5 to 10 lines.
\item \textbf{Present the paper contribution:} A third paragraph were you state what you do in the paper, this should also be concisely written. A good rule of thumb is to make it max 10/15 lines. Here, you should state up front:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the problem at stake, 
\item the relevance of what you propose, 
\item the technique you use, possibly underlying its novelty, efficiency, 
\item underline the value/novelty of your proposal, referencing (recent) papers from the literature,
\item tell the reader how she/he can take advantage of your work, e.g., how your work/results can be reused/exploited to achieve further scientific, technical or practical goals.
 \end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Summary of contributions:} After this, you may want to provide an itemized list to summarize the paper contributions. Rule of thumb: from three to six items, from three to four lines each.
\item \textbf{Closing (paper structure):} You finish up by detailing the paper structure, this should be three to four lines. It is customary to do so, although I admit it may be of little use. It usually goes like: {\it ``This report (paper) is structured as follows. In Section II we describe the state of the art, the system and data models are respectively expounded in Sections~III and~IV. The proposed signal processing technique is presented in Section~V and its performance evaluation is carried out in Section~VI.''}\\
\end{itemize}}

\MR{Lately, I tend to write introduction plus abstract within a single page. This forces me to focus on the important messages that I want to deliver about the paper, leaving out all the blah blah. \textbf{Remember:} 1) {\it less is more}, 2) writing a compact ({\it snappy}) piece of technical text is much more difficult than writing with no space constraints.}
